	abstract = {Precision Agriculture ({PA}) was originally developed to address variability in soil and crop parameters for large-scale agriculture in developed countries. The general concepts of {PA} can also be adapted for farm-based agriculture for small and marginal farmers in Developing Countries. This approach is characterized by a farmer-soil-crop database acquired from the ﬁeld, crop calendars provided by agricultural experts, real-time acquisition of parameters such as temperature and rainfall through sensors, and an analytical model that simulates the crop calendar using static, semi-static and dynamic inputs, leading to farmer- and crop-level support advisories delivered through devices such as mobile phones and tablets.},

In this study, we firstly reviewed the technical systems and bascial benefits of {PA}, and then evaluated the effects of {PA} technology on winter wheat yield, residual soil nitrogen and economic benefit.Three treatments, single precision seeding technology ({PS}), integrated precision seeding with laser land leveling technologies ({PLS}) and conventional land leveling and seeding technologies ({CLS}) were established in winter wheat cropland of central China. The result showed that {PLS} rather than {PS} significantly increased wheat yield and straw biomass after one season. {PS} treatment significantly reduced residual soil {NO}3--N and {NH}4+-N, whereas {PLS} treatment only significantly decreased residual soil {NH}4+-N. Adoption of {PA} technology increased net return by 4.95\%, 37.60\% and 30.16\% for {PS}, sudsidy and non-subsidy of {PLS} treatments, respctively. Our study suggested that integrated {PLS} was the good application pattern than single {PS} to improve wheat yield, reduced residual soil nitrogen and increased net return.},

One of the possible answers to the emerging problems of pollution and efficiency is the use of precision agriculture. The one of the greatest challenges of the agricultural sector is to feed significantly more people on more or less the same size of agricultural land. The size of the utilized agricultural cannot be expanded significantly. The other pillar of the production growth is the higher yields. It can be reached in various ways starting from optimal fertilizer use, more fertile seeds to irrigation. Precision agriculture use most of these opportunities. {PA} can contribute to food security and safety, it supports sustainable farming ({EP}, 2016). The high initial costs, {PA} technologies are closely related to the farm size, which is an important factor of the adoption.},

However, drones are limited by the weight they can carry and battery power resulting in limited resources. Moreover, some applications require utilising multiple drones to act in coordination. The combination of utilising nearby devices (i.e. with additional resources beyond the drone capability) and controlling multiple drones in a more convenient way has the potential to overcome these limitations. This paper proposes and examines programmable crowdpowered drones, involving two key concepts for combining drones and smartphones as a crowd-powered resource cloud. In particular, we focus on crowdsourcing for drone computations, and multi-drone service management using a new scripting language for coordinated ﬂight paths of multiple drones. We describe our underlying model and experimentation with these concepts. We then extensively discuss the prospect of drones servicing communities within {IoT} ecosystems, as a future direction.},

One of the problems with these devices concerns the limited quantities of fuel and pesticide.
